# Dungeons CORE
hobby-project by Mike Egger

## Work-in-progress!
Text-based turn-based Dungeon-crawler with randomized loot and rooms. Highly modular items, skills and enemies allow for customization and extension of the games assets.
Gameplay currently supports
* doing a dungeon run consisting of multiple rooms with randomized enemies and chests
* equipping and looting items
* turn-based combat
* leveling-up character and individual skills
* learning and equipping skills

I/O can also be exchanged by any graphical output / other input methods if it's needed (currently there is a Text-only output and input).
